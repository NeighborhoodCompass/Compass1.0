        "importance": "The diversity of land uses can reflect the richness of social and economic life in a community. Just as mixed uses in a single property are desirable for bringing people and their service or amenity needs closer to one another, the same is true within neighborhoods. Land use diversity can have transportation, health and environmental associations as well as create greater collocation of jobs and housing.",
        "tech_notes": "A higher value in this measure reflects both a higher number of land use categories present and more properties in each category. A measure of 100 would mean each of the possible types of land use is present and that there is an equal number of each. A measure of 0 would mean only one type is present. The calculation of this measurement uses the Simpson Index of Diversity.",

This measure reports the two most severe categories of deterioration, poor and unsound, as a percentage of all owner- and renter-occupied residential units. For neighborhood areas showing the highest concentrations of poor and unsound properties (between 3.5% and 8% of all residences) the impacts can be considerable to neighborhood safety, public health, and even property values. In those areas, multiple poor and unsound properties can be found on a single block.",

The latter two are defined as follows: poor, showing marked deterioriation; unsound, may be unfit for habitation or condemned. For the measure reported here, these two categories are combined.",
